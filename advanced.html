<p>Only you could make those words cute. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Watching ice melt. This is fun. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>
<p>Makes me a … scientist. God created pudding, and then he rested. <strong> Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss.</strong> <em> After all, you are a client.</em> Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>

<p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I have a dark side, too. Like a sloth. I can do that.</p>

<p>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>God created pudding, and then he rested.</li><li>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</li><li>You're a killer. I catch killers.</li>

<p>I will not. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>
<p>He taught me a code. To survive. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
<p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. God created pudding, and then he rested. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<p>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I am not a killer. Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I have a dark side, too. I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>

<p>I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. You look…perfect. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
